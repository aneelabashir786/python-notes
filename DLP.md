<h5>Difference bewteen  AI/ML/DL</h5>

<h6>Artificial Intelligence (AI)</h6>

**Definition:** The broadest field.

**Goal:** To create machines that can simulate human intelligence — such as reasoning, problem-solving, decision-making, and understanding natural language.

**Scope:** Covers all approaches that make machines act “smart”, even if they don’t learn from data.

**Example:**
1. Rule-based expert systems
            
2. Chatbots with predefined responses
            
 3. Self-driving cars (overall system uses many AI techniques)

<h6>Machine Learning (ML)</h6>

**Definition:** Subset of AI.

**Goal:** To create systems that can learn patterns from data and improve automatically with experience instead of being explicitly programmed.

**How:** Algorithms find statistical relationships in data to make predictions or decisions.

**Examples:**

1. Spam email detection

<h6>Deep Learning (DL)</h6>

Definition: Subset of Machine Learning.

Goal: To use artificial neural networks (especially deep neural networks with many layers) to automatically learn complex patterns and representations from large amounts of data.

How: Uses architectures like feedforward networks, CNNs (Convolutional Neural Networks), RNNs (Recurrent Neural Networks), and Transformers. These models can learn features directly from raw data (like images, text, or audio) without manual feature engineering.

Examples:

Image recognition (e.g., detecting cats vs. dogs in photos)

Speech recognition (e.g., Siri, Alexa, Google Assistant)

Natural Language Processing (e.g., ChatGPT, translation, summarization)

<h2>Limitation of ML</h2>

ML  is not good to handle high dimentional data and its not easy to do feature selection and object recognition 

DEEP LEARNING is computationally expensive but it is good with high dimentions and there is no need to do feature selection . it is done automatically .
