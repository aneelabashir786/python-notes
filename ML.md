<h1>Machine Learning</h1>
<h3>Definition</h3>

" ML is a field of CS that uses statistical techniques to give Comuter Systems the ability to learn with data , without being explicitly programmed" 

<h5>Difference bewteen  AI/ML/DL</h5>

<h6>Artificial Intelligence (AI)</h6>

**Definition:** The broadest field.

**Goal:** To create machines that can simulate human intelligence — such as reasoning, problem-solving, decision-making, and understanding natural language.

**Scope:** Covers all approaches that make machines act “smart”, even if they don’t learn from data.

**Example:**
1. Rule-based expert systems
            
2. Chatbots with predefined responses
            
 3. Self-driving cars (overall system uses many AI techniques)

<h6>Machine Learning (ML)</h6>

**Definition:** Subset of AI.

**Goal:** To create systems that can learn patterns from data and improve automatically with experience instead of being explicitly programmed.

**How:** Algorithms find statistical relationships in data to make predictions or decisions.

** Examples:**

1. Spam email detection

2. Movie recommendation systems

3. Predicting house prices
