<h5>Difference bewteen  AI/ML/DL</h5>

<h6>Artificial Intelligence (AI)</h6>

**Definition:** The broadest field.

**Goal:** To create machines that can simulate human intelligence — such as reasoning, problem-solving, decision-making, and understanding natural language.

**Scope:** Covers all approaches that make machines act “smart”, even if they don’t learn from data.

**Example:**
            1. Rule-based expert systems
            2. Chatbots with predefined responses
            3. Self-driving cars (overall system uses many AI techniques)
